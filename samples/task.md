Please have a look at this material. It should give you an idea of what we are trying to do. 
At first we want to keep it very simple: 
just create a table that contains a list of firms with some firm characteristics.

In order to perform this task, we will need to have a frontend that speaks to our current backend. 
Once that is done we can think about how to visualize the data using plotly. 
For example we can create a graph like the one attached!
